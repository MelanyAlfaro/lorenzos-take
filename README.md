# Lorenzo’s Take

Lorenzo’s Take is a gamified educational web application designed to help high school students develop critical reading and speaking skills in English.

The platform is built around interactive “quests” based on controversial and thought-provoking topics aligned with secondary education learning objectives. Each quest includes:

- A short reading passage
- Comprehension mini-games
- Guided opinion-building activities
- Vocabulary practice with connectors
- An experience points (XP) system

Students progress by completing quests and earning XP, while teachers can review participation and provide feedback on short oral recordings.
